## From analyzing minds to computer programming ##



```
if(practicedCoding == true)
{
    codingSkill += 1; 
    console.log("You're on the path to becoming a code ninja!")
}

else 
{
    codingSkill += 0;
    console.log("Go back to the dojo!") 
}
```


Our brains are, in some ways, quite similar to computers and I've often used metaphors to make this comparison during therapy sessions with clients who have been struggling with conditions such as burn out, depression or PTSD (*Posttraumatic Stress Disorder*). Computers, like our human minds, have working memories and will have a harder time functioning if overloaded with too many processes and requests at the same time. They might even freeze up or shut down completely. 

Computers have become an invaluable tool in our lives and can sometimes be a source of great frustration, especially if designed without human psychology in mind. During my years of working as a counsellor and Cognitive Behavioral Therapist I've not only been fascinated by the complexity of the human mind and how to, by using therapy as the tool, aid clients in reaching an improved quality of life - I've also become increasingly curious of the "psychology" behind the technology that we interact with on a daily basis. This has made me want to pursue a career in programming so that I can learn how to create digital tools while at the same time maintaining a psychological perspective.
